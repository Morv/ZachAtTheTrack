Your program should use the above payout and odds chart.  You need to allow a user to  add money to his or her bank.  You will assume the person starts with no money.  If the person runs out of money he or she cannot play.  The person can never bet more money than they have.  The program should allow the person to see their bank balance at anytime.  The program should allow a deposit or withdraw to be made from the bank at anytime.  The program will allow the person to make a bet and pick a horse...once the bet is placed the program will run the race.  Once the race is done the bank will be updated and a message will be displayed such as Horse 5 won the race you lost XXX dollars -OR- Congratulations you horse "Horse 7" won...you have just won $XXX dollars.  You now have $XXX in the bank.  My guess is you gotta allow them to quit...and so on.

The program needs to output the name of all past winners along with the times that horse won a race.
